🔧 Keras Neural Network Hyperparameter Tuning
This project demonstrates how to improve the performance of a Neural Network model using Keras Tuner for hyperparameter tuning. The key focus is to explore and optimize:

📌 Optimizer Selection

📌 Number of Nodes per Layer

📌 Number of Hidden Layers

📌 Overall Model Architecture

All experiments are performed in Python using TensorFlow and Keras libraries.

🚀 Objective
The goal is to maximize the performance of a feed-forward Neural Network by intelligently tuning the model’s key hyperparameters using Keras Tuner. This project walks through:

Selecting the best optimizer (e.g., Adam, RMSprop, SGD)

Tuning the number of neurons in each layer

Deciding on the number of layers to use

Training the best version of the model based on tuning results

🧪 Tools & Libraries
Python

TensorFlow

Keras

Keras Tuner

NumPy & Pandas



🛠️ How Hyperparameter Tuning is Performed
Keras Tuner is used to define a search space for:

Optimizer type

Number of layers

Number of units per layer

The tuner evaluates multiple combinations to find the best one using:

RandomSearch (or other tuning algorithms)

Validation accuracy or loss as the objective

📊 Results
The model performance significantly improved after tuning.

Best hyperparameters found:
